# routopsy

Routopsy is a toolkit built with the purpose of attacking the overlooked networking protocols we discuss in our talk. Routopsy currently supports performing attacks against Dynamic Routing Protocols (DRP) and First-Hop Redundany Protocols (FHRP). Most of the attacks currently implemented make use of a weaponised 'virtual router' as opposed to implementing protocols from scratch. The tooling is not limited to the virtual routers, and allows for further attacks to be implemented in python3 or by adding additional containers.

For further information regarding the usage and such, refer to the Wiki @ https://github.com/sensepost/routopsy/wiki
